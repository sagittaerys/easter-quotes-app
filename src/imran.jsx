        Beneath the crown of thorns was purpose, <br />
        Behind the tomb, a greater dawn. <br />
        May you carry Easter in your spirit— <br />
        Always resurrecting, always becoming more.... <br />

        I'd like to think, there’s a kind of discipline in your game that shows you don’t just love football — <br />
        You live it... <br />

        Sky's just the beginning, Agba-Baller!
