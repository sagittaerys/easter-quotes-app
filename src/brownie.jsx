          Like dawn breaking through the tomb’s silence, <br />
          Your soul too rises, radiant and resolute. <br />
          May this Easter cradle your gentleness in light— <br />
          A reminder that beauty is born from both courage and grace. <br />

          Your confidence is something beautiful to behold, <br />
          Do not let the world take that away from you.
