      He rose not in thunder, but in the stillness of loveâ€” <br />
      A King in silence, a Lion with scars. <br />
      May this Easter remind you: <br />
      Even warriors are born again by peace. <br />

      Your calmness and honesty in the face of uncertainty is admirable, <br />
      Have a great one, Zeke!
