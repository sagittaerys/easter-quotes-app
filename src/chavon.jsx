      <p className="quote">
      The sea once parted. The stone once rolled. <br />
      Resurrection is the art of becoming again. <br />
      Let Easter whisper to your soulâ€” <br />
      You too are being remade, quietly, powerfully. <br />

      May your well of sacarsm and sexual innuendos never run dry, werey.... <br />
      Have a great one
